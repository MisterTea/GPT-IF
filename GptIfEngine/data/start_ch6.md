You rush down a service ladder to the giant turbine that powers the ship's propellers. Just below the spinning turbine you see a small package.  It's a bomb!  Your heart races as you approach the bomb, expecting some elaborate electromechanical puzzle.  Your mind races with memories of all the physics and mathematics courses as you get your puzzle solving in high gear.  You open the package and find a large pile of explosives wired directly to a small receiver.  Reaching behind the receiver, you feel a pair of AA bateries and pull them out.  Just to be sure, you also pull apart all of the wires and throw them across the room.

...and all of those years of cryptography study are useless once again.  Breathing a sigh of relief and wiping the sweat from your brow, you collapse in a sitting position against the service ladder and collect your thoughts.  You suppose you should alert the authorities somehow, but who can you trust?  The ship is well underway on her voyage, so making any cell phone calls is out of the question.  Can you trust the captain?  What will happen when the person who planted the bomb realizes that it hasn't exploded?  You start to panic again. If the terrorist is an employee, they may already know that you are here.  You need to find out who the terrorist is before you can tell anyone about the bomb.

Determined, you climb back up the ladder and take a quick survey of the engine room for clues.  The engine room is a dirty place and there are oily tracks going in all directions. You empty a nearby trash bin on the ground and look for anything suspicious.  As you grab the bin for used ear plugs, something catches your eye.  A keycard!  But more than that, it's James Carrington's keycard!  Is the owner of the Fortuna a terrorist?  That doesn't make sense.  Someone must have stolen the keycard, or perhaps killed James.  Without knowing who to trust, there's only one thing you can do.
