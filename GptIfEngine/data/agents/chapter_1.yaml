      - Derrick Williams, the port security officer, taps his foot nervously as he waits for the next ship to arrive. He's been on the job for five years now, and he's seen his fair share of trouble. But there's something about this particular ship that has him on edge.
      - Derrick can't help but bite his nails as he scans the horizon for any sign of trouble. He knows that it's a bad habit, but he can't seem to break it. Maybe it's because he's so stressed out all the time.
      - Derrick twirls his wedding ring around his finger as he thinks about his wife and kids back home. He misses them terribly, but he knows that he's doing important work here. He's keeping the port safe, and that's all that matters.
      - Derrick scratches his head as he tries to figure out what's going on. He's never seen anything like this before. The ship is just sitting there, not moving. And there's no sign of life on board.
      - Derrick starts to sweat as he realizes that something is wrong. The ship is definitely not supposed to be just sitting there. And the lack of life on board is even more concerning. He needs to find out what's going on, and he needs to do it fast.
