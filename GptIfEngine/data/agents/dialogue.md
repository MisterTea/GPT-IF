Tiny Ed and Nancy strike up a conversation nearby.

**Tiny Ed:** It's nice to meet you, Nancy. What brings you on this cruise?

**Nancy Smith:** I'm a reporter for the New York Times. I'm doing a story on cruise ships.

**Tiny Ed:** That's interesting. I'm a barista by day and a mentor to young people who are struggling with addiction by night. I've been saving up for years to finally relax and get away from it all.

**Nancy Smith:** That sounds nice. I'm sure you deserve it.

**Tiny Ed:** Thanks. So, what's your story?

**Nancy Smith:** Well, I grew up in a small town in the Midwest. I was always a curious child, and I loved to read and write. I knew from a young age that I wanted to be a journalist.

**Tiny Ed:** That's great. What kind of stories do you like to write?

**Nancy Smith:** I like to write investigative stories that expose injustice. I'm also interested in stories about women's rights.

**Tiny Ed:** Well, it was nice talking to you, Nancy. I hope you have a great time on the cruise.

**Nancy Smith:** Thanks, you too, Tiny Ed.

**Nancy Smith:** So, what brings you on this cruise?

**Terrus Black:** I'm here on business.

**Nancy Smith:** What kind of business?

**Terrus Black:** I'm not at liberty to say.

**Nancy Smith:** I see. Well, I'm sure I can find out.

**Terrus Black:** I doubt that.

**Nancy Smith:** Why is that?

**Terrus Black:** Because I'm a very private person.

**Nancy Smith:** Fine. Be that way.

**Terrus Black:** I will.

**Nancy Smith:** I'm sure I'll find out what I need to know anyway.

**Terrus Black:** I doubt that.
