A chipper woman jumps up and grabs your hand in a firm, but remarkably soft, handshake. She is wearing a nametag that reads "JUNE" and has an american flag pinned on the corner.

**June:** Hello, there. I'm June Hope, your VIP tour guide.

**Alfred:** Hi, I'm Alfred Bunberger.

**June:** It's nice to meet you, Alfred. What brings you on this cruise?

**Alfred:** I... got very lucky with a sweepstakes entry. I'm taking a short break from my research on black holes.

**June:** That's fascinating. I've always been interested in space myself.

**Alfred:** Me too. It's such a vast and mysterious place.

**June:** I know. It's hard to believe that we're just a tiny speck in the universe.

**Alfred:** It is. But it's also amazing to think about all the possibilities that are out there.

**June:** I know. It's like anything is possible.

June is tall and slender, with long brown hair and blue eyes. She is well-dressed and has a confident air about her. She glances over your shoulder and, with a pat on the arm, walks past you to greet another VIP.

**June:** Enjoy the lounge and mingle with some of the guests! The exclusive full-ship tour will commence after some words from the ship's owner.
