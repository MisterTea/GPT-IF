**CHAPTER 2**: A Fateful Tour.

As you step off the gangway onto the grand atrium of the cruise ship, you take a deep breath and soak in the moment. People are milling about, chatting and laughing. You can hear the sound of music playing in the distance. Simply being on the post-COVID inaugural journey of the Fortuna is a luxury for most passengers. In your case, it's nothing short of a miracle.

You are Alfred Bunberger, an astrophysicist specializing in black hole theory. At 32 years old, you were born and raised in Tampa, Florida, and currently reside at the University of South Florida. As a low-income PhD candidate, you prefer to dress casually in jeans and a t-shirt, wearing glasses and a military challenge coin in your pocket.

As a child, you were fiery, but aloof and often depressed. Your parents were supportive despite their personal troubles and your family's financial difficulties. You had read about famous universities such at Harvard and MIT in books, but the arrest of your father, the sole provider for the family, locked away those dreams. While you were fortunate to attend a state school with a full scholarship, you learned the hard way that individual achievement can only take someone so far in academia. A stack of post-doc rejection letters from all of your favorite universities is what remains of those ambitions.

What you lack in direction, you make up for in time. Time to think; time to tinker. One of your hobby projects was a computer script that crawled the Internet and signed you up for every sweepstakes site it could find. Many of the sweepstakes required filling out forms or answering surveys, which was easy with new Large Language Models (LLMs). With the help of Josh in the computer science department, you automated the entire sweepstakes process end-to-end.

Just before the summer break, you loaded the script on hundreds of machines across campus and sent them to work. After a few days, one of the artificial intelligence bots earned $500 and deposited into your account. You promptly transferred the money to your father's prison commissary. A few other prizes showed up in your account: Almost enough to cover all of the campus electricity and compute you were consuming. This was clearly not a sustainable business (eventually the university staff would catch on), but it could help make ends meet and keep your father from getting beat up for not paying his debts to other prisoners.

Then one day, you won a sweepstakes prize that would change your life forever.

And here you are, on an all-expenses paid cruise on the beautiful Fortuna. But not just as any ordinary guest: You also won a complete VIP package including an exclusive VIP tour of the ship.

The VIP tour starts in two hours. In the meantime, you intend to meet as many people as you can, learn about the glorious ship, and pretend - just for a moment - that you belong on this gilded journey.
