# cruise_terminal

## Full

You are standing in the cruise terminal. It is a large, bustling space with people everywhere. There are families with small children, couples on their honeymoon, and groups of friends on vacation. Everyone is excited to be here, and the atmosphere is electric.

The cruise terminal is divided into several sections. There is a _check-in desk_ where you can get your boarding pass and luggage tags. There is also a _security area_ where you will be screened for weapons and other prohibited items. Once you have cleared security, you will find yourself in the departure lounge. This is where you will wait to board your ship.

The _departure lounge_ is a large, comfortable space with plenty of seating. There are also several restaurants and shops where you can buy food, drinks, and souvenirs. If you are feeling restless, you can also take a walk around the terminal or relax in one of the many _lounge chairs_.

A television screen fixed to a column is playing an information video on loop. This may be a good time to **watch the television**.

The check-in desk stands between you and the gangway to the **north**.

The gangway is made of metal and is about 10 feet wide. It is lined with railings on both sides to prevent passengers from falling overboard. The gangway is slightly sloped, so that passengers can easily walk up and down it.

There is also a concierge desk where you can get help with anything you need.

The grand atrium is the heart of the ship, filled with light and activity.

# treading_water

## Long

The boat, capsized, sinks rapidly into the dark abyss of the gulf. You are treading water in the gulf. You are not sure what to do. You have no food or water, and you are not sure how long you will be able to survive. You start to think about all the things you will miss, and all the things you will never get to do. You start to think about death, and you are not sure if you are ready to die. You look for other passengers but it's hard to see anything over the waves.

You try to stay calm and think clearly, but it is hard. The sun is beating down on you, and the waves are crashing over you. You are exhausted, and you are starting to lose hope. You know that you cannot survive in the gulf for much longer. You need to find a way to get to land.

{% world.ask_to_press_key() %}

You look around, and you see nothing but water. You start to swim, but you are not making any progress. The waves are too strong, and they are pushing you back towards the open gulf. You start to panic, and you think that you are going to die.
