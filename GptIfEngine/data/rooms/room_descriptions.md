## Tic 5

A tall man with dark hair and eyes uses a short staircase as a stage and clears his throat. The hum dies down. You recognize the man instantly as James Carrington, the owner of the Fortuna.

James Carrington is a 45-year-old financier. He is tall, handsome, and well-dressed. James was born into a wealthy family and attended Harvard University, where he earned a degree in business. After graduating from Harvard, James went to work on Wall Street. He quickly rose through the ranks, and by the time he was 30, he was a multi-millionaire. However, James's luck soon changed. He made a series of bad investments, and by the time he was 45, he was facing bankruptcy. James is now determined to rebuild his financial empire. His drive and energy is infectious: before he even begins speaking, you feel compelled to take up arms and join him on any quest.

**James Carrington:** Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard the Fortuna, my newest and most luxurious cruise ship. I'm James Carrington, the owner and operator of this ship, and I'm honored to have you all here.

**James Carrington:** I know you're all wondering why I've invited you here. Some of you are here because you have a large megaphone, even if it hasn't been the kindest to me.

An unexpected laugh causes Nancy Smith to spit a partial mouthful of vodka sour into her glass. She attempts unsuccessfully to control a coughing fit.

**James Carrington:** And for some of you, today is just your lucky day.

Point to the dragon, to the shore of Normandy. You would do anything for James Carrington right now.

{{ world.ask_to_press_key() }}

**James Carrington:** Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm starting a new chapter in my life. I've been through a lot in the past few years, but I've come out the other side stronger than ever. And I'm ready to start over. This ship is my way of starting over. It's a symbol of my new beginning. And I want you all to be a part of it.

**James Carrington:** I've spared no expense in making this ship the best it can be. The accommodations are luxurious, the food is delicious, and the entertainment is world-class. And I'm confident that you'll all have a wonderful time on board. But this ship is more than just a vacation destination. It's also a business venture. I'm hoping to make this ship the most successful cruise ship in the world. And I need your help to do it.

**James Carrington:** I'm asking you to spread the word about this ship. Tell your friends, family, and colleagues about it. And when you're on board, be sure to leave a positive review online. With your help, I know we can make this ship a success. And I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Thank you, and enjoy this beautiful ship.

James pulls out his cell phone and begins speaking to someone. After a few moments, he raises his right hand in a half-cheer half-salute.
