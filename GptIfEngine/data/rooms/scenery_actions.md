## sit

It looks comfortable, but you know that you shouldn't sit on it. If you do, you might set off an alarm or get into trouble with the security guards.

# cruise_terminal_security_area

## look

The security area at a cruise terminal is a busy and important place. It is where passengers are screened for weapons, explosives, and other prohibited items before boarding their cruise ship. The security area is typically staffed by security guards and/or law enforcement officers. Passengers are required to pass through a metal detector and have their carry-on luggage x-rayed. They may also be asked to remove their shoes and belt. The security area is designed to keep passengers safe and to prevent the smuggling of dangerous items onto cruise ships.

# cruise_terminal_lounge

## look

The departure lounge at a cruise terminal is a comfortable and relaxing space where passengers can wait to board their cruise ship. The lounge typically has seating, restrooms, and a food and beverage service. Some departure lounges also have entertainment options, such as televisions, games, and live music. The departure lounge is a great place to relax and unwind before your cruise vacation. It is also a good place to meet other passengers and make new friends.

# cruise_terminal_chair

## look

The lounge chair at a cruise terminal is a comfortable and relaxing piece of furniture. It is typically made of a durable material such as plastic or aluminum, and it has a soft, padded seat and back. The lounge chair is also adjustable, so you can find the perfect position to relax in. It is a great place to sit back and enjoy a book, a magazine, or a cup of coffee while you wait to board your cruise ship.

## take

If you take the lounge chair, you will be caught. The cruise terminal is full of security cameras, and the lounge chairs are all tagged with a tracking device. If you are caught, you will be arrested and charged with a crime. You could also be sued by the cruise line.

Even if you are not caught, taking the lounge chair is still a bad idea. It is wrong to steal, and it is also a crime. You could also get in trouble with your parents or guardians if they find out.

So, it is best to just leave the lounge chair alone.

An attractive terminal hostess is gesturing as a narrator explains how to embark the ship:

> "When it is time to board your ship, you will be directed to a specific gate. Once you have boarded, you will be greeted by a crew member who will show you to your cabin. Your cabin is your home away from home for the duration of your cruise. It is typically small but comfortable, and it will have everything you need for a relaxing vacation."

> "Once you have settled into your cabin, you can explore the ship. There are many things to see and do on a cruise ship. You can go swimming in the pool, play games in the arcade, or watch a movie in the theater. You can also eat at one of the many restaurants, or take a class in something new."

> "Cruise ships offer a variety of activities for all ages. Whether you are looking for a relaxing vacation or an action-packed adventure, you will find it on a cruise ship! Thanks for watching, and have a great cruise!"

Hiya!  It's your friendly programmer again.  In text adventures, you can move by typing the direction that you wish to travel.  For example, the cruise check-in desk is to the north, so you can go there by simply typing NORTH.  GO NORTH, WALK NORTH, RUN NORTH, etc. also works.

You could easily steal it, but you know that it would be a bad idea.

If you steal the television, you will be caught. The cruise terminal is full of security cameras, and the television is probably tagged with a tracking device. If you are caught, you will be arrested and charged with a crime. You could also be sued by the cruise line.

Even if you are not caught, stealing the television is still a bad idea. It is wrong to steal, and it is also a crime. You could also get in trouble with your parents or guardians if they find out.
