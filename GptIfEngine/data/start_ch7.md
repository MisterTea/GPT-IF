The door to the safe unbolts and begins to swing open.  Before you can even see what is inside, you thrust your hands through the safe doorway and jam your fingers against the hard plastic of the safe walls.  You grab a heavy envelope and open it.  Inside are stacks of one-hundred dollar bills, bound together in groups of ten.  This is more than enough money to pay off all of your student debt, but you are still no closer to finding out who is trying to blow up the ship and whether you will live long enough to spend it.  As you ponder what to do next, you hear a *click*.

{{< pagebreak >}}

You slowly turn around to see Terrus, the man who forced his way off the VIP tour early, standing in the bathroom, pistol in hand.  The pistol is pointed at your forehead.  Terrus has a fresh bruise on his face, likely from his altercation with the now-deceased Officer Schooner.

**Terrus:** Who are you working for?  How did you steal my keycard?  How did you get the safe password?  Start talkin', boy.

{{< pagebreak >}}

At gunpoint, you explain almost everything to Terrus.  Officer Schooner, the gym locker, the bomb, the keycard.

**Terrus:** You should have left that alone, boy.  Now look what you got yourself into.

Terrus pauses and casually strolls over to the cabin doorway, pistol trained on your face.  As he walks by you, he grabs the envelope from your hand.

**Alfred:** Why are you trying to blow up the ship?

Terrus spins around and whips you across the temple with the butt end of his pistol.  Your vision blurs and you feel your skin open up.  Blood begins to pour down your face.  It turns your vision red as it covers your left eye.  You struggle to your knees.  Everything in the room has multiplied.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**Terrus:** Shut up kid, this is the end of the road.  You've been at the wrong place at the wrong time, for the last time.

Terrus plunges a hypodermic needle into the side of your chest and empties the contents into your side.  You cry out in pain and try to resist, but his strength is overpowering.

Life flashes before you. Your parents at your graduation.  The police showing up and interrogating you about your father.  Your first kiss.  The first time you rode a bike.  Your brain searches through it's archives for something, anything that can prevent what is going to happen next.

Terrus knocks over the television, sending it crashing to the floor next to you.  You notice that he is wearing gloves, and no one is going to find his fingerprints.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**Terrus:** You tried fentanyl for the first time and took way too much.  You hit your head on the TV when you passed out.  This is how you will be remembered.  Goodnight, boy.

Your whole body feels like jell-o.  Every object in the room begins dancing.  You strugle to your feet, but fall over again.  Terrus opens the door to the cabin to make his exit...

{{< pagebreak >}}

You want to follow Terrus out of the room, but the door is about 24901 miles away.  24901, the circumfrence of the Earth.  You feel yourself leaving the blue ball and traveling upwards...  You start to house regrets.  Could you have made more friends, been more persuasive?  Maybe you should have gone straight to the captain, even though Schooner forbade it.  In the heavens, a faint voice echos through your mind.  You expected the voice of God to be louder:

{{< pagebreak >}}

**(voice):** ... Schooner autopsy ... get the NARCAN ... 

{{< pagebreak >}}

**(voice):** ... make sure you get a good spray ... 

{{< pagebreak >}}

**(voice):** ... nose full of blood, did he get a full dose? ...

{{< pagebreak >}}

[blue]Your current goal is: ...[/]

[yellow]A room with ceiling tiles[/]

You see a white blur, that becomes a set of blurs, that become a grid of blurs, that eventually materialize into a grid of tiles.  You are in some office or medical room.  You try to move your body, but your arms and legs are chained to a bed.

{{< pagebreak >}}

&gt; LOOK

[blue]Your current goal is: Living[/]

[yellow]A hospital room[/]

You look around what is now clearly a hospital room.  You have an IV in your left arm and a set of monitors on your arms and chest.  A cardiac event monitor chirps nearby.

**(voice):** For the record, when I said we would pick up your tab at the end of the cruise, that doesn't include your hospital bills.

You turn to see June get up from a makeshift bed across the room and grab your hand.  Her hand must be the warmest thing you have felt in days.  Maybe the warmest in your life.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**Alfred:** I didn't take fentanyl!  Terrus is a killer!  He killed officer Schooner!  You need to believe me!

The cardiac event monitor warning goes off and the small chirping becomes a loud, drilling drone that pierces your brain and makes you wince.  June, still clasping your left hand with her right, holds you down gently with her free hand.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**June:** They got Terrus and he told the cops everything in a plea bargain.  James hired Terrus to sabatoge the ship engine as the ship would be entering Blind Man's bluff.  The ship would have crashed into the bluff and sank.  James was planning to blame the crash on faulty equipment, then have a claim to the insurance money.

At this, you are speechless.  Clearly, you suspected James after finding his key card near the bomb, but, deep down, you always hoped that he was trying to save the ship just like you were.  You breathe a sigh and let these fact sink in.

**Alfred:** So what happened to James?

**June:** You aren't going to like this, but I need you to remain calm... he's walking free.

The cardiac event monitor starts spiking again.  A nurse button lights up.  You force yourself to relax and calmly tell the nurse that everything is alright.  The nurse arrives in the room a few moments later and removes your restraints.  You slowly sit up in the hospital bed, letting your legs dangle off the side of the bed.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**June:** All they have is Terrus' confession and the money in the safe.  It's not enough evidence to convict someone of murder.  But it's more than enough for James to not get one penny of the insurance.  James owes a lot of people a lot of money and, without the insurance money from the Fortuna, there's no way he can pay it back.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**June:** I know it's a lot to take in.  The company that insured the Fortuna needs both of us alive and well to testify, so they are covering your hospital bills and giving both of us private security for the next few months.  I'm sure it will be tough to get back to your university research but after a few weeks-

**David:** Hopefully not that tough!

{{< pagebreak >}}

You realize David is now standing in the hospital room doorway.  He strolls over to your and drops a short stack of papers in your lap.  The front page is a W-4 form.  Puzzled, you start leafing through the paperwork.  June grins at David and he gives her a short wink before turning back to you.

**David:** The CFA is always looking for the best and the brightest.  I owe you the rest of my life, so the least I can do is spare a few hours a week for another post-doc.

Tears begin welling up in your eyes.

{{< pagebreak >}}

**Alfred:** I... I don't know what to say.  Thank you, sir!  I won't let you down!

**David:** I'm sure of that, my boy.  I need to catch a plane to Cambridge: come to my office once you have recovered.
